Build it with Webpack on TypeScript and deployed on GitHub pages

  - `yarn build`
- Commit and push to master

## Impediments

I couldn't resolve `.env` using [dotenv webpack](https://github.com/mrsteele/dotenv-webpack). Is a known problem when webpack is written on TS, I used Mozilla convict to introduce envs.
